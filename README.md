# Vanilla Frontend Project Boilerplate

This is a Frontend Development Boiler for Creatinf Vanilla(html, CSS, Javascript) Projects.
We also try to make use of SASS whereever we can.

To `install` `sass` enter the following in the terminal:

```javascript
npm install sass
```

To `auto` `transcompile` enter the following in the terminal:

```javascript
sass --watch sourcefile.scss:destinationfile.css
```
